## Abstract

The problem of toxic pollution of the environment by combustion products of explosives and rocket fuel is becoming increasingly important in the context of intensified military operations. In this study, the toxicity of TNT derivatives, hydrazine-based compounds, and nitroaromatic transformation products related to explosive and rocket fuel contamination was evaluated using the model organisms *Tenebrio molitor* Linnaeus, 1758 and *Opatrum sabulosum* (Linnaeus, 1761). We chose hydrazine derivatives, nitroanilines, benzene and naphthalene-based nitro compounds that can persist in the ground, water and atmosphere after explosions or incomplete combustion of rocket fuel. Topical dispersion was used to evaluate exposure of specified doses on the surface of containers containing larvae and imagoes of *T. molitor* and imagoes of *O. sabulosum*, followed by lethality counts and LC₅₀ determination. The results indicate the high sensitivity of *T. molitor* larvae and imagoes and *O. sabulosum* imagoes to TNT derivatives, hydrazine compounds, and nitroaromatic contaminants commonly found in explosive-contaminated environments, which confirms the feasibility of introducing ecotoxicological monitoring of military-technological impact zones. The systematic toxicity assessment of these 29 explosive-related compounds provides essential baseline data for environmental risk modeling and ecotoxicological monitoring programs. The data obtained can be used for further modeling of environmental risk and development of bioindicator approaches to detect pollution as a result of military operations, for example, in Ukraine.
